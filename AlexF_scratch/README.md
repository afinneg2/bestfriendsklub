Needed to run code in this folder  
+ Directory structure must contain the following sub-tree

```
.
+-- raw/
  +-- train/
  |  +-- *.tiff files for train data set
  +-- test/
  |  +-- *.tiff files for test data set
```
  
+ must have folder containing ./utils/ on your PYTHONPATH
+ must have cv2 (aka openCV) python package installed \
+ there are probably other requirements but things are too messy right now for me to know what they are
